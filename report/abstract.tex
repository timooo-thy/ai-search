This report presents the design, implementation and evaluation of CodeOrient, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Search tool, designed to accelerate developer onboarding. This application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), code graph visualisation and vector-based retrieval to help new developers understand unfamiliar codebases and reduce the time to first commit.

CodeOrient integrates semantic code search using embedding models, structural analysis through dependency graphs and generative user interfaces (UI) to provide context-aware feature cards. Through the use of Retrieval-Augemented Generation (RAG) with source grounding, the application eliminates hallucination, commonly seen in AI code assistants. Preliminary testing suggests that by externalising the mental model of a codebase through a unified graph-and-card interface, the system significantly reduces the cognitive load associated with onboarding and system discovery in large-scale repositories.
